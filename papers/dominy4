Introduction
The relationships among primate feeding behavior, diet, and mandibular morphology are of central importance to anthropologists seeking to link behavioral ecology with functional and evolutionary morphology (e.g., Hylander, 1979a, Bouvier, 1986, Ravosa, 1991, Ravosa, 1996a, Daegling, 1992, Taylor, 2002, Taylor, 2006, Wright, 2005, Daegling and McGraw, 2007, Taylor et al., 2008, Hogg et al., 2011 and Ross et al., 2012). When primates chew or bite, their jaw muscles apply loads to the mandible. These loads, in turn, cause internal stresses and strains in the mandible. Food material properties (FMPs) modulate both the magnitude and duration of jaw-muscle activity (Ahlgren, 1966, Luschei and Goodwin, 1974, Hiiemae, 1978, Hylander, 1979b, Thexton et al., 1980, Oron and Crompton, 1985, Chew et al., 1988, Hylander and Johnson, 1994, Agrawal et al., 1998 and Ross et al., 2007) such that food elastic modulus and toughness are associated with the complexity of jaw movements, recruitment levels of jaw-muscle force, and/or jaw loads. It is this empirically demonstrated relationship between FMPs, jaw-muscle activity patterns, and mandibular loads that has led many investigators to draw functional and adaptive conclusions about feeding behavior and diet from jaw form in both living and fossil primates (Jolly, 1970, Hylander, 1979a, Hylander, 1988, Smith, 1983, Daegling, 1989, Daegling, 1992, Cole, 1992, Spencer and Demes, 1993, Antón, 1996, Ravosa, 1996a, Ravosa, 2000, Taylor, 2002, Taylor, 2006, Wright, 2005, Vinyard and Ryan, 2006, Strait et al., 2009 and Dumont et al., 2011). Identifying morphological responses to mandibular loads in extant taxa is key to testing diet-based ecological models of species diversification, and to extending these models to fossil taxa. However, the functional relationships among jaw form, feeding behavior, and diet are complex and expected morphological differences have not been consistently observed (Daegling and Hylander, 2000, Daegling and McGraw, 2001, Daegling and McGraw, 2007, Taylor et al., 2008, Ross et al., 2009 and Ross et al., 2012).

One reason for the variance between theoretical expectations and empirical findings may relate to the historic reliance on qualitative descriptions of coarse-grained diet classifications (e.g., folivore, frugivore) and food classes (e.g., fruit, terrestrial herbaceous vegetation) as meaningful proxies for FMPs (Hylander, 1979a, Daegling, 1992, Anapol and Lee, 1994, Ravosa, 1996b and Taylor, 2006). Numerous comparative studies of primate mandibular morphology have been based on the classically held assumption that leaves are tough, seeds are hard, and fruits are soft, and thus it has been assumed that food mechanical properties map neatly onto dietary categories (Hylander, 1975, Rosenberger and Kinzey, 1976, Beecher, 1979, Smith, 1983, Smith, 1984, Peters, 1987, Peters, 1993, Rosenberger, 1992, Anapol and Lee, 1994, Daegling and McGraw, 2001 and Taylor, 2006). Not surprisingly, for some of these studies, predicted morphological relationships based on these broad dietary classes have not been systematically borne out by the data (Bouvier, 1986, Ravosa, 1991, Daegling and McGraw, 2001, Daegling and McGraw, 2007, Taylor, 2002, Taylor et al., 2008, Wright et al., 2009 and Ross et al., 2012). It seems plausible that the reliance on qualitative descriptors in lieu of quantitative data on FMPs clouds these relationships.

Relatively few studies linking jaw morphology to FMPs in wild primates have incorporated quantitative FMPs data such as toughness (R) or Young's modulus (E) ( Kinzey, 1978, Peters, 1987, Kinzey and Norconk, 1990, Kinzey and Norconk, 1993, Dumont, 1995, Yamashita, 1998, Yamashita, 2003, Lucas, 2000, Lambert et al., 2004, Wright, 2005, Teaford et al., 2006, Dominy et al., 2008, Vogel et al., 2008, Vogel et al., 2009, Norconk et al., 2009, Vinyard et al., 2009 and Daegling et al., 2011). This is primarily because the technology to reliably and accurately measure FMPs in the field was only made available for widespread use around a decade ago ( Lucas et al., 2001). The extent to which qualitative dietary descriptions accurately track FMPs remains an open question, but the fact that foods of disparate dietary categories display overlapping material properties ( Williams et al., 2005 and Vogel et al., 2008) suggests that such qualitative descriptions may not always provide accurate substitutes for FMPs. Thus, for all but a handful of primate species, hominoids included, the expectation of a functional and adaptive relationship between mandibular morphology and food mechanical properties remains largely speculative.

Orangutans as a natural experiment
Sumatran (Pongo abelii) and Bornean (Pongo pygmaeus wurmbii) orangutans are closely-related species whose dietary differences are well documented ( Knott, 1998, Knott, 2001, Delgado and van Schaik, 2000, Wich et al., 2006 and Morrogh-Bernard et al., 2009). On average, Sumatran and Bornean orangutans incorporate similar average percentages of fruit in their diet, but the minimum percentage of fruits is much higher for Sumatran orangutans ( Wich et al., 2006). While Sumatran orangutans spend more time feeding on ripe fruit pulp, Bornean orangutans spend more time feeding on items that have been identified as fallback foods, including inner bark, leaves, and other vegetation. Fallback foods (sensu Marshall and Wrangham, 2007) are low-quality, abundant items that are eaten when preferred foods are scarce. The majority of Bornean orangutan fallback foods is significantly tougher and more resistant to deformation than their preferred fruits ( Vogel et al., 2008) and feeding on mechanically challenging fallback foods has been argued to play an important evolutionary role in shaping primate craniodental morphology ( Rodman, 1977, Kay, 1981, Lambert et al., 2004, Ungar, 2004, Laden and Wrangham, 2005, Wright, 2005, Taylor, 2006, Marshall and Wrangham, 2007, Taylor et al., 2008, Ungar et al., 2008, Vogel et al., 2008, Vogel et al., 2009, Constantino et al., 2009, Marshall et al., 2009, Wright et al., 2009, Daegling et al., 2011 and McGraw and Daegling, 2012).

In a previous study, Taylor (2006) compared mandibular morphology among Bornean and Sumatran orangutan populations. At the time the study was conducted, feeding behavior and diet were based on documented differences in habitat productivity, qualitative estimates of FMPS inferred from food type (i.e., bark and some vegetation were presumed to be mechanically more difficult to process than fruit pulp), and field observations of percentage of time spent feeding on these different foods (MacKinnon, 1974, Rodman, 1977, Rodman, 1988, Rijksen, 1978, Leighton, 1993, van Schaik, 1999, Delgado and van Schaik, 2000 and van Schaik and Knott, 2001). Dietary profiles based on these data led Taylor to hypothesize that P. p. wurmbii load their jaws more frequently, and possibly with relatively greater forces, compared with P. abelii. Thus, Taylor predicted that P. p. wurmbii would exhibit mandibular features that reflect the demands of a more mechanically challenging diet. Taylor's predictions were generally supported by the data, which demonstrated that compared with P. abelii, P. p. wurmbii have relatively deeper mandibular corpora, wider mandibular symphyses and larger condylar areas. Taylor functionally linked these mandibular features in P. p. wurmbii to their need to generate and resist relatively larger and/or more frequent occlusal loads associated with processing more mechanically challenging foods. However, in the absence of quantitative data on FMPs, Taylor's conclusions remain largely untested.

Given their close phylogenetic relationship and divergent feeding behaviors and diets, orangutans provide a natural experiment to empirically test the functional relationships among feeding behavior, FMPs, and jaw form. To this end, we quantified the mechanical properties of foods consumed by P. abelii (Ketambe, Sumatra) and compare these data with previously reported estimates ( Vogel et al., 2008) of FMPs for P. pygmaeus wurmbii (Tuanan, Borneo). Given that P. p. wurmbii relies more heavily on leaves, seeds, and inner bark ( Morrogh-Bernard et al., 2009) and exhibit a relatively more robust mandible, we predict that P. p. wurmbii consumes foods that are tougher and have a higher elastic modulus compared with those of P. abelii. We also recorded fruit abundance (i.e., high versus low) and compared the percentage of time P. abelii and P. p. wurmbii spent feeding on various foods. We use these data to test whether differences in feeding behavior and FMPs support previous functional interpretations of variation in mandibular morphology between P. abelii and P. p. wurmbii ( Taylor, 2006) and provide the first test of the functional link between FMPs and jaw form between two closely related hominoid species of the same genus.

Materials and methods
Study sites and subjects
The Ketambe research station (3° 41′ N, 97° 39′ E) is located in the Gunung Leuser National Park, Leuser Ecosystem, Sumatra, Indonesia. The research area is mostly covered by pristine rainforest from the alluvial lowlands at ca. 350 m to higher altitudes around 1000 m above sea level (Rijksen, 1978 and van Schaik and Mirmanto, 1985). However, nearly one-fifth of the research area (450 ha) has been subjected to intense selective logging (Hardus et al., 2012). The Tuanan research station (2° 09′ S; 114° 26′ E) is located in the Mawas Reserve in Central Kalimantan, Borneo, Indonesia. This site consists of peat swamp on shallow peat (<3 m); it is disturbed, having been subject to selective commercial logging in the early 1990s followed by almost a decade of informal logging. Since the end of 2002, there has been no logging in the area. Research on orangutans has been continuous at Ketambe since 1971, except for a brief interruption from 2001 to 2003. During the time of this study there were ca. 20 habituated, regularly-followed individuals in the research area. At Tuanan, focal behavioral data on ca. 19 individuals have been collected regularly since 2003 using the same standardized protocols employed at Ketambe (see below).

Behavioral methods
We conducted full-day focal follows on all study animals using standardized methodology at both sites (van Schaik, 1999 and Morrogh-Bernard et al., 2002) and only included nest-to-nest data in our analyses. During focal follows, we recorded the activity of the focal animal every two minutes. If the study subject was feeding, we recorded the plant species, the item consumed, and the stage of maturation of the food item (i.e., immature/mature). Feeding data from Ketambe are based on 4992 feeding hours collected from February 2001 until June 2009 while data from Tuanan are based on 7273 feeding hours collected from July 2003–June 2007. Dietary data used to examine the percentage of time spent feeding on different food items were collected on adult females from Ketambe (n = 8) and Tuanan (n = 9) that were fully habituated at the time of the studies. We restricted these dietary comparisons to females as sex ( Harrison et al., 2009 and Morrogh-Bernard et al., 2009) and age ( Jaeggi et al., 2008, Jaeggi et al., 2010 and van Schaik et al., 2009) differences in diet selection have been documented within populations.

Mechanical measurements of foods
Food mechanical properties (FMP) data were collected at Ketambe from August 2007–July 2008 and May 2010–August 2010 and at Tuanan from July 2005–June 2006. Foods eaten by P. abelii and P. p. wurmbii were collected during standard focal data collection using the same methodology and equipment ( Vogel et al., 2008). We sampled the stages of maturity and vegetative tissues of 125 plant species at Ketambe, all of which were included in the orangutan diet during the eight consecutive years of long-term focal observations used for this study ( Appendix 1). Fresh fruit, bark, leaves, and other vegetative (e.g., stems, peat, orchids, and non-woody pith) samples were collected during focal feeding bouts. Feeding bouts began at the time the focal individual initiated feeding in a tree and terminated when the individual stopped feeding. Food items for analysis were obtained in situ by ascending trees or by collecting items that had fallen from the tree during a feeding bout ( Vogel et al., 2008). At least two specimens were collected from a given food patch whenever possible. Fresh samples were placed in sealed plastic bags with moist paper towels, transported to the field station, photographed, and processed the same day they were collected. We categorized stage of maturation on the basis of external cues that signify the development of a particular species (e.g., color, size, and texture of unripe or ripe fruit and associated seeds).

We measured FMPs with a portable universal tester (Darvell et al., 1996 and Lucas et al., 2001). We quantified two FMPs: toughness (R) and Young's (elastic) modulus (E; resistance to deformation). We define toughness (J m-2) as the amount of energy required to initiate and extend a crack of a given area ( Ashby, 1992, Vincent, 1992, Lucas, 2004 and Lucas et al., 2012a). We define Young's modulus (MPa) as the ratio of stress to corresponding strain along the linear portion of the stress–strain curve ( Ashby, 1992, Lucas, 2004 and Williams et al., 2005).

Toughness was measured for fruit exocarp, mesocarp and endosperm, leaves, inner bark (i.e., cambium/phloem), and other vegetation. Toughness of fruit parts was measured using the wedge test (Lucas et al., 2001, Lucas et al., 2012a and Lucas, 2004). To account for anisotropic variation within a fruit, at least two mechanical measurements were taken from both hemispheres and averaged. Toughness was calculated by dividing the area beneath the force–deformation curve by the product of crack depth (i.e., wedge displacement) and initial specimen width (Lucas et al., 2001). For leaves, inner bark, and other vegetation (e.g., orchids, pith), samples were fractured using cobalt scissors (Dovo, Germany) mounted on the tester (Darvell et al., 1996, Dominy et al., 2003, Dominy and Lucas, 2004 and Lucas, 2004). When consuming bark, orangutans typically strip the outer bark from the tree and scrape the cambium/phloem tissues from the tree or outer bark with their incisors.1 Once scraped from the outer bark, it is then chewed and swallowed or wadged and expelled (spat) from the mouth. Subsequent examination of this quid or wad can provide clear evidence of molar-induced fracture of individual plant fibers. Thus for bark feeding, we use the term phloem/cambium or inner bark as this is the tissue orangutans masticate with their molars. We measured Young's modulus of fruit exocarp (husk), mesocarp (pulp), and endosperm (seed) with cylinder compression tests (Lucas et al., 2001) following Vogel et al. (2008).2

In addition to toughness and Young's modulus, we calculated displacement-limited (R/E)0.5 and stress-limited (ER)0.5 fragmentation indices separately for each fruit part (e.g., exocarp, mesocarp, and endocarp) using the mean of Young's modulus and toughness ( Agrawal et al., 1997, Lucas et al., 2002, Lucas, 2004 and Williams et al., 2005). To calculate fragmentation indices, we only include food items for which we measured both Young's modulus and toughness ( Williams et al., 2005). 3 Displacement-limited foods allow cracks to initiate easily, but resist propagation of the crack through the plant tissues. Foods that are stress-limited generally prevent cracks from initiating easily, but have little structure available to prevent cracks from propagating through the tissue once a crack has been generated ( Lucas, 2004 and Williams et al., 2005).

Statistical analyses
We calculated average toughness (R) and Young's modulus (E) for food samples collected during a single feeding bout ( Vogel et al., 2008 and Vogel et al., 2009). We used the two-tailed, nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis to test for statistical differences in E and R among food items consumed by P. abelii at Ketambe. For post-hoc multiple comparisons, we used Tukey's HSD ( Zar, 1999). To test for differences in E and R between immature and mature tissues of the same plant part we used the Wilcoxon sign-test.

To address the hypothesis that P. p. wurmbii ingests and masticates foods that are significantly tougher and more resistant to elastic deformation compared with P. abelii, we compared previously published values from Tuanan ( Vogel et al., 2008) with the mechanical properties of food items consumed at Ketambe ( Appendix 1). We used one-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum tests (or the parametric equivalent, Welch's ANOVA for unequal variances, if appropriate) to evaluate differences in toughness and modulus of plant tissues (immature and mature parts combined) and differences by stage of maturity. We used the Bonferroni-Holm correction to minimize Type I error for all comparisons ( Rice, 1989).

We summarized data on percentage of feeding time spent on food items from Ketambe and Tuanan by taking monthly averages across adult females following Harrison et al. (2009) to avoid issues related to autocorrelation of data among sampling days within the data sets. We used two-tailed tests to evaluate species differences in the percentage of feeding time spent on food items. Additionally, we used the nonparametric Spearman rank correlation to examine associations between percentage of feeding time and FMPs (e.g., E and R), separately by species.

We set the significance level for all tests at α < 0.05 and noted trends toward significance (0.05 < p < 0.10). All statistical procedures were carried out using JMP-SAS 8.0.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) and R (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing: http://www.R-project.org).

Results
Mechanical properties of foods at Ketambe
The toughness of foods ingested and masticated by P. abelii ranged from 18.7 J m−2 for mature fruit pulp of Palaquium sp. to 4058.7 J m−2 for mature seeds of Diospyros sumatrana ( Table 1). Similar to findings for P. p. wurmbii ( Vogel et al., 2008), average R of plant tissues masticated by P. abelii differed significantly from one another ( Table 1 and Fig. 1A), with inner bark the toughest tissue and significantly tougher than fruit mesocarp, fruit exocarp, and leaves. Inner bark was not significantly tougher than fruit endosperm and other vegetation (e.g., pith and orchids). When we evaluated differences in FMPs by phenophase we observed that average immature fruit exocarp and mesocarp tended to be tougher than ripe tissues, although these differences did not reach statistical significance (0.05 < p < 1.0) ( Table 1). By contrast, maximum R of immature fruit mesocarp was 1.5 times that of mature mesocarp ( Table 1). Likewise, we found no average difference in R between ripe and unripe endosperm ( Table 1), but maximum R of mature endosperm was higher ( Table 1), consistent with previous findings from Tuanan ( Vogel et al., 2008). Our sample size for mature leaves consumed by P. abelii was too small to test for phenophase differences.

Whole model tests for variation in mechanical properties of foods consumed by P. abelii include all seven food items but do not include stage of maturity: toughness: Kruskal–Wallis test: χ2 = 33.0, df = 6, p < 0.0001; Young's modulus: Kruskal–Wallis test χ2 = 19.35, df = 2, p < 0.0001.
b
Multiple post-hoc pairwise comparisons for differences in toughness among food items using Tukey–Kramer HSD: inner bark is significantly tougher than fruit exocarp (p = 0.04), leaves (p = 0.04), and fruit mesocarp (p < 0.0001) and approaching significance for fruit endosperm (p = 0.06); fruit endosperm is significantly tougher than fruit mesocarp (p = 0.03). All other pairwise comparisons for toughness were not significantly different (p > 0.05).

Multiple post-hoc pairwise comparisons for differences in Young's modulus among food items were calculated using Tukey–Kramer HSD: compared with fruit mesocarp, E was significantly higher for endosperm (p = 0.001) and exocarp (p < 0.0001). Overall, unripe fruit was also more resistant to deformation compared with ripe fruit (Wilcoxon rank-sum test χ2 = 10.32, df = 1, p = 0.0014). All other comparisons for Young's modulus were not significantly different (p > 0.05).

Notably, while there were significant differences in FMPs among food categories (e.g., fruit, leaves, inner bark), we observed considerable overlap between traditional plant part categories in both toughness and Young's modulus (Table 1 and Appendix 1). Equally important, plant phenophase and plant part (e.g., endosperm, mesocarp, exocarp) influence variation in the mechanical properties of foods consumed by these orangutan populations. Collectively, these findings underscore the inadvisability of inferring FMPs for a specific food item or food part from qualitative descriptions of whole foods or food classes.

Young's modulus (E) of foods consumed by P. abelii ranged from less than 1.0 MPa for mature fruit pulp of Palaquium sp. to 8.5 MPa for immature husk of Ficus sp. ( Table 1). Tissues masticated by P. abelii differed in average E, with fruit endosperm and exocarp significantly more resistant to deformation compared with mesocarp ( Table 1). Tests of fruit (all parts combined) by phenophase further showed that unripe fruit was significantly more resistant to deformation compared with ripe fruit ( Table 1). In particular, E of unripe (immature) fruit exocarp and mesocarp was significantly higher compared with ripe (mature) tissues ( Table 1; Fig 1B). However, at Ketambe, there were no differences in Young's modulus of mature and unripe endosperm ( Table 1; Fig. 1B), whereas at Tuanan, mature seeds were significantly more resistant to deformation ( Vogel et al., 2008). We note, however, that our sample size for seeds of unripe fruit consumed at Ketambe was low (n = 4), resulting in low statistical power for this analysis (power = 0.27).

Food mechanics compared between P. abelii and P. p. wurmbii
Toughness (R)
P. pygmaeus wurmbii consumed significantly tougher ripe and unripe fruits (all parts combined) compared with P. abelii ( Fig. 2A). Upon further examination of differences by fruit part and phenophase, we observed that compared to P. abelii, P. p. wurmbii consumed significantly tougher ripe fruit exocarp and endosperm, and significantly tougher unripe exocarp and mesocarp ( Table 2 and Fig. 2B–D). With respect to non-fruit tissues, P. p. wurmbii masticated significantly tougher inner bark and leaves compared with P. abelii ( Table 2 and Fig. 3).

We used one-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for all pairwise comparisons and report p-values as described below. First entry is the p-value from a one-tailed test of predicted differences between P. p. wurmbii and P. abelii. Second entry provides results of a two-tailed test for differences between the two species only when the one-tailed test resulted in no statistical difference in the predicted direction. A significant result for a two-tailed test indicates a difference between the two species opposite the predicted pattern. Bold and italicized p-values signify significant species differences (α = 0.05) in toughness or modulus after accounting for multiple pairwise comparisons using the Bonferroni-Holm correction ( Holm, 1979) per mechanical property per plant tissue. Bold p-values signify p < 0.05 but not significant following the Bonferroni-Holm correction. P-values that are not bold indicate trends toward significance 0.05 < p < 1.0 in the predicted direction. Statistical tests are not reliable for n < 5. Given the limitations of our equipment, we did not test for differences in Young's modulus for leaf lamina or inner bark.

Young's modulus (E)
Pongo p. wurmbii consumed ripe fruit with significantly higher modulus (all parts combined) compared with P. abelii but there were no species differences in modulus of unripe fruits ( Fig. 4A). Breaking down fruit into its constituent tissues by phenophase, P. p. wurmbii masticated mature fruit mesocarp with a significantly higher modulus compared with Pongo abelii ( Table 2 and Fig. 4B). Pongo pygmaeus wurmbii also consumed mature fruit endosperm with an average modulus (E) 1.5 times greater than that of P. abelii, but this difference was not statistically significant. However, contrary to our predictions, P. abelii masticated immature fruit exocarp with a significantly higher modulus compared with P. p. wurmbii ( Table 2).

Fragmentation indices
Fruits (all parts combined) consumed by P. p. wurmbii were significantly more displacement-limited (χ2 = 3.8, df = 1, p = 0.03) and stress-limited (χ2 = 3.1, df = 1, p = 0.04) compared with P. abelii. The higher displacement-limited index for P. p. wurmbii is accounted for largely by higher (R/E)0.5 for both immature and mature exocarp and immature endosperm ( Table 3). All ripe and unripe fruit parts have higher stress-limited indices for P. p. wurmbii with the exception of immature exocarp, with the greatest differences for mature mesocarp and endosperm ( Table 3).

Food selection compared between P.p. wurmbii and P. abelii
Compared with female P. abelii, female P. p. wurmbii spent a significantly greater percentage of feeding time on immature leaves, unripe fruit, flowers, and other vegetative parts ( Table 4). These differences were apparent during periods of both high and low fruit abundance for unripe fruit and other vegetative parts, but the percentage of time spent feeding on immature leaves and flowers was greater only during periods of low fruiting ( Table 4). Pongo abelii spent more feeding time on ripe fruit during both high and low fruit abundance and, unexpectedly, on inner bark and mature leaves during high fruiting periods ( Table 4).

For P. abelii, we observed a low but significant inverse correlation between percentage of time spent feeding and R (ρ = −0.262, p = 0.004) and a slightly higher inverse correlation between percentage of time spent feeding and E (ρ = −0.319, p = 0.062). These correlations were non-significant for P. p. wurmbii (R, ρ = 0.022, p = 0.756; E, ρ = 0.092, p = 0.400).

Discussion and conclusions
Food mechanical properties and feeding behavior at Ketambe and Tuanan
We predicted that compared with P. abelii, P. p. wurmbii ingest and masticate significantly tougher foods. This prediction is affirmed by our findings that P. p. wurmbii consumed significantly tougher fruit parts, leaves and inner bark, and foods with a significantly higher displacement-limited index. Pongo abelii selected for less tough fruit parts (both ripe and immature) compared with P. p. wurmbii ( Table 1) and spent a greater percentage of feeding time on foods that were less tough and less resistant to deformation, supporting previous reports that P. abelii prefer ripe fruit (e.g., Wich et al., 2006). Preliminary data from Ketambe also suggest that ripe fruit is higher in total kilojoules of energy per item compared with unripe fruits ( Zulfa, 2011). Thus, orangutans likely select fruits based on a combination of factors, including lower food mechanical properties and greater caloric gain, potentially along with additional features such as food size and shape (e.g., Norconk et al., 2009).

By contrast, our data do not consistently support the prediction that P. p. wurmbii ingest and masticate tissues with a significantly higher modulus (but see further discussion below). While P. p. wurmbii consumed mature fruit mesocarp that was more resistant to deformation, P. abelii consumed immature exocarps with higher modulus and we observed no species differences in modulus of endosperm ( Table 2). Pongo p. wurmbii did consume fruits with a significantly higher stress-limited index compared with P. abelii ( Table 3). However, our highest modulus values for P. abelii and P. p. wurmbii were 8.5 MPa (for immature husk of Ficus) and 12.0 MPa (for ripe fruit endosperm of Elaeocarpus mastersii), respectively, placing these tissues somewhere between carrot and apple-skin ( Williams et al., 2005). In addition, stress-limited indices for both orangutan species are low compared with domesticated foods fed to primates in a laboratory (cf. Williams et al., 2005) 4 and compared with Sacoglottis gabonensis seeds commonly masticated by sooty mangabeys ( Daegling et al., 2011). Given the similarities in modulus values of foods masticated by the two orangutan species, differences in (ER)0.5 ( Lucas et al., 2012b) are largely accounted for by differences in toughness.

Importantly, at Tuanan, P. p. wurmbii demonstrated a preference for several foods of high elastic modulus that were not quantified due to the measurement limitations of the load cell and our inability to reduce the size of the seeds for testing (see Lucas et al., 2009). These include the mature seeds of Mezzetia parvifolia, which are regularly comminuted when available and have previously been estimated at a Young's modulus of 9.4 GPa ( Lucas et al., 2012b), and Mezzetia umbellate and Xylopia fusca. Bornean orangutans have been observed to feed on M. parvifolia seeds by placing the seed between the molars with the germinating band running both vertically and horizontally and cracking open the seed ( Lucas et al., 2012b; Vogel, Personal observation). When available, Mezzetia parvifolia seeds comprise ∼11% of total monthly feeding time and are high in lipids (Vogel, Unpublished data), suggesting that they are an important source of lipids for the Tuanan orangutans. The Tuanan FMP data ( Vogel et al., 2008) thus likely underestimate maximum elastic modulus of tissues ingested and masticated by P. p. wurmbii by several orders of magnitude. By contrast, while no tissues ingested and masticated by P. abelii were excluded from analysis due to load cell limitations, many fruits sampled at Ketambe had thin exocarps, which could not be processed for measuring Young's modulus. Thus, we speculate that the average modulus of fruit exocarps consumed by P. abelii may decrease with a better sample of the low-end range. Given these limitations, we consider our modulus data for Ketambe and Tuanan as preliminary.

Consistent with previous studies of orangutan feeding behavior (Morrogh-Bernard et al., 2009), Sumatran orangutans spent more feeding time on ripe fruit during both high and low fruiting periods while Bornean orangutans spent a greater percentage of feeding time on immature leaves, particularly during low fruiting periods, along with unripe fruits, flowers, pith, and other structural vegetation. These differences in fruit consumption reflect, to some extent, the higher fruit productivity on Sumatra compared with Borneo (Wich et al., 2011). At the same time, orangutans feed on fallback foods such as leaves even when fruit is available likely to maximize protein intake. Recent studies have found that Bornean orangutans tend to experience protein deficits during both low and high fruit periods (Vogel et al., 2012 and Vogel et al., 2014). When fruit is scarce, orangutans rely on these lower energy foods to maintain a positive or neutral energy balance state (Emery Thompson and Knott, 2008 and Vogel et al., 2014).

Notably, however, we observed no species differences in time spent feeding on inner bark during low fruiting periods and during high fruiting periods, P. abelii actually spent significantly more time feeding on inner bark compared with P. p. wurmbii. Our results thus not only conflict with previous reports that Sumatran orangutans spend a lower percentage of time feeding on inner bark compared with Bornean orangutans ( Delgado and van Schaik, 2000, Wich et al., 2006 and Morrogh-Bernard et al., 2009), but indicate that during this study Sumatran orangutans fed more regularly on inner bark compared with Bornean orangutans. Our preliminary nutritional data from Tuanan and Ketambe suggest that inner bark is relatively low in protein but similar to fruit in total non-structural carbohydrates (Vogel, Unpublished data), and thus likely serves as an important source of energy for both orangutan species. Conflicting findings in bark consumption between the current and previous studies may reflect variation in feeding behavior across sampling periods and sites, particularly given sizeable temporal and regional fluctuations in fruit availability ( Wich et al., 2011). Rothman et al. (2006) found that decaying bark provides sodium to mountain gorillas, and thus it is possible that bark consumption may also be linked to the acquisition of limiting nutrients. Additional long-term studies and systematic sampling at multiple sites are needed to better understand the role of inner bark in the orangutan diet.

Linking feeding behavior, food material properties and mandibular morphology in orangutans
Compared with P. abelii, P. p. wurmbii ingested and masticated significantly tougher foods and foods characterized by a significantly higher displacement-limited index. In comparison to other large-bodied hominoids, our data show that P. p. wurmbii feed on some of the toughest tissues, and previously published data indicate that they feed on tissues with exceptionally high elastic modulus ( Table 4; Lucas et al., 1994, Elgart-Berry, 2004, Taylor et al., 2008, Vogel et al., 2008 and Lucas et al., 2012b). We note, however, that some smaller-bodied platyrrhines (e.g., Cebus apella and Cebus libidinosus) and catarrhines (e.g., Cercocebus atys) feed on exceptionally tough foods equivalent to those ingested and masticated by P. p. wurmbii ( Table 5).

(2008) and modulus data are from this study and Lucas et al. (2012b)).

At Tuanan, the greatest percentage of time spent feeding on any single item was 9.5% during the study period (Vogel, Unpublished data), and we found no relationship between percentage of time spent feeding and FMPs. While the greatest percentage of time spent feeding by P. abelii on any single item was also fairly low (6.5%), percentage of time spent feeding was significantly inversely correlated with food toughness (and trended towards a significant inverse correlation with modulus). Collectively, these findings support the hypothesis ( Taylor, 2006) that the relatively robust mandible of P. p. wurmbii is functionally linked to generating and dissipating loads associated with feeding on significantly tougher foods.

What of the role of fallback foods in driving species differences in mandibular morphology? Our data on percentage of time spent feeding in relation to fruit abundance permit us to comment on inner bark and its potential influence as a fallback food in exerting selection pressures on orangutan mandibular morphology (e.g., Lambert et al., 2004 and Wright et al., 2009). Marshall and Wrangham (2007) define fallback foods as foods of low preference but high seasonal importance and exploited during periods when preferred foods are unavailable. Consumption of inner bark is negatively correlated with the availability of preferred foods in P. p. wurmbii ( Vogel et al., 2008) while P. abelii fed on bark during both high and low fruiting periods ( Table 4). Thus, following Marshall and Wrangham (2007), inner bark would seem to qualify as a fallback food for P. p. wurmbii but whether it meets the definition of a fallback food for P. abelii is less clear. Even if inner bark is a fallback food for both species, it is difficult to marshal a case in favor of inner bark as a fallback food influencing mandibular robusticity in P. p. wurmbii given that we find that both species exploit inner bark when preferred foods are unavailable. As noted previously, P. p. wurmbii fed on significantly tougher inner bark compared with P. abelii ( Table 2). Therefore, it seems likely that inner bark toughness (i.e., its mechanical property) plays more of a role in shaping the relatively robust mandible of P. p. wurmbii than its classification as a fallback food, and if fallback foods exert selection pressures for mandibular adaptations in orangutans, additional foods (i.e., leaves) are involved.

We speculate that strain magnitudes associated with the habitual mastication of foods by P. p. wurmbii are relatively low. Several factors suggest this is a reasonable speculation. First, P. p. wurmbii spent approximately 60% of their feeding time on foods with toughness values of ∼1000 J m−2 or less (Vogel, Unpublished data). Data for macaques ( Hylander et al., 1998) indicate average working- and balancing-size corpus shear strains of 724 με and 501 με, respectively, for foods ranging in toughness between ∼663 and 1000 J m−2 ( Williams et al., 2005). Average principal strains experienced by macaques are somewhat lower for these same foods ( Hylander, 1979b). These strain magnitudes are relatively low in comparison to empirically observed habitual strain magnitudes as high as 1000–3000 με experienced by a range of vertebrates ( Vinyard et al., 2007). Of the remaining 40% of feeding time on items greater than 1000 J m−2 at Tuanan, 15% of feeding time was spent on tissues ranging in toughness between 1000 and 2000 J m−2, 10% on tissues between 2000 and 3000 J m−2 and 15% on tissues greater than 3000 J m−2.

Thus, if, as argued by Ross et al. (2012), the number of chews generated in a primate's lifetime at strain magnitudes of between 2000 and 3000 με is unlikely to be sufficient to result in fatigue failure, the relatively robust mandible of P. p. wurmbii may be functionally related to countering larger external forces required to process the toughest tissues. Toughness has been linked to mandibular robusticity in other extant primates (e.g., Wright, 2005 and Norconk et al., 2009) and fossil hominins ( Daegling et al., 2011). Importantly, loads are cumulative and reflect both frequency and magnitude; repetitive cycling at 2000–3000 με coupled with countering relatively large loads could result in fatigue failure. We further hypothesize that additional modulus data for the high-end range of tissues ingested and masticated by P. p. wurmbii, as documented by Lucas et al., 1994 and Lucas et al., 2012b, are likely to support a functional relationship between the relatively robust mandible of P. p. wurmbii and their feeding on stress-limited foods, as the influence of these two material properties on mandibular morphology need not be mutually exclusive.

We acknowledge that bone modeling and remodeling in response to applied loads are dynamic, micro-level processes that occur throughout an animal's lifetime, while our morphological comparisons of orangutan mandibles are drawn on static snapshots of adult phenotypes. We do not know how these micro-level processes mitigate the risks of yield strain or fatigue failure and these risks increase with age-related declines in bone strength (Biewener, 1993). Nor, for that matter, is it well understood how these processes relate to peak loads for the mandible (Rubin and Lanyon, 1984, Rubin and Lanyon, 1985, Frost, 1987, Frost, 2003, Rubin et al., 1991, Daegling, 2010, Ravosa et al., 2010 and Daegling et al., 2013). Thus, we acknowledge that our FMPs data are several steps removed from data necessary to directly link the observed variation in feeding behavior and FMPs with mandibular robusticity.

Mandibular versus dental correlates of orangutan feeding behavior and diet: mixed signals?
In a recent study, Smith et al. (2012a) found no significant variation in average tooth enamel thickness between Bornean and Sumatran orangutans, observing only a trend toward relatively thicker enamel in Bornean compared with Sumatran females. Smith et al. (2012a) conclude that their results offer only limited support for ecological explanations of enamel thickness variation in great apes. These findings are somewhat unexpected given that enamel thickness has been functionally and evolutionarily linked to the mastication of mechanically challenging foods (Molnar and Gantt, 1977, Kay, 1981, Teaford and Ungar, 2000, Grine, 2005, Teaford, 2007, Lucas et al., 2008a, Lucas et al., 2008b, Constantino et al., 2009 and Lee et al., 2010).

A factor that may contribute to the differences between our findings for mandibular morphology and those of Smith et al. (2012a) for enamel thickness pertains to our different sampling strategies. As in the current study, Taylor (2006) tested functional predictions about mandibular morphology between P. abelii and select geographic populations of Bornean orangutans, specifically focusing on P. p. wurmbii and P. p. morio of known locality, and whose feeding behavior and diet were well documented. By contrast, Smith et al. (2012a) pooled dental samples from Bornean orangutans (P. pygmaeus spp.) of unspecified locality for comparison with Sumatran (P. abelii) orangutans. Given the well documented craniomandibular ( Courtenay et al., 1988, Groves et al., 1992 and Taylor, 2006), dental ( Uchida, 1998), and ecological ( Delgado and van Schaik, 2000 and Morrogh-Bernard et al., 2009) variation amongst Bornean orangutan populations, averaging enamel thickness across Bornean specimens has the potential to obscure ecologically meaningful patterns of variation both among Bornean orangutan populations and between P. abelii and Bornean subspecies. Future studies of the functional significance of tooth enamel thickness in orangutans and other primates would benefit from meticulous geographic analyses amongst species or populations of known locality and whose feeding ecology is well documented, including data on abrasives in the diet in addition to FMPs ( Rabenold and Pearson, 2011 and Pampush et al., 2013).

Implications for ecological models of craniodental morphology in fossils
The comparative anatomy of primate jaws and teeth continues to play a central role in ecological models linking primate morphology with feeding behavior and performance in living (Vinyard et al., 2003, Wright, 2005, Norconk et al., 2009, Wright et al., 2009, Yamashita et al., 2009, Daegling et al., 2011, McGraw et al., 2012, Smith et al., 2012a and Terhune, 2013) and fossil taxa (Lucas et al., 2008c, Smith et al., 2012b, Eng et al., 2013 and Strait et al., 2013). This approach is useful for revealing a species' full range of functional capabilities. However, ecological context is what allows us to narrow this range to capture how species utilize their masticatory anatomy in their biological role (sensu Bock and von Wahlert, 1965), and to hypothesize adaptations to variation in feeding behavior and diet.

As seen in the present study, even with data on feeding behavior integrated with higher resolution FMP data, our interpretations remain limited. Does the morphological profile we observe for P. p. wurmbii reflect the ingestion or biting of items with exceptionally high modulus involving peak bite forces, similar to what has been reported for C. atys ( McGraw et al., 2011)? Does it reflect the ingestion or chewing of fibrous foods of low or moderate toughness, potentially involving an increased number of masticatory cycles (i.e., repetitive loading of the mandible), but not necessarily high muscle and bite forces, as may be the case for some baboons ( Dominy et al., 2008)? Does it reflect the exploitation of hard or exceptionally tough fallback foods, when preferred foods are unavailable ( Lambert et al., 2004; Wright, 2005 and Wright et al., 2009)? Or does it reflect some combination of these behaviors? We cannot pinpoint the precise mechanism(s) underlying the increased jaw robusticity in P. p. wurmbii, particularly as we lack a full appreciation of the additive and synergistic effects of strain frequency and magnitude on mandibular form. That said, our findings that P. p. wurmbii ingest and masticate significantly tougher foods compared with P. abelii while P. abelii select for less tough foods, and the likelihood that additional studies will find that P. p. wurmbii feed on tissues of exceptionally high modulus, all point to a mechanical link between peak loads and mandibular robusticity in orangutans.

The challenges we face in interpreting the functional and adaptive significance of mandibular morphology in extant orangutans are only compounded in paleontological investigations. Indeed, given the absence of quantitative empirical data on feeding behavior in the fossil record and the uncertainties surrounding the specific loading conditions responsible for alterations in mandibular bone morphology, it is not surprising that there are various interpretations of the adaptive significance of the robust australopith skull (Daegling et al., 2013 and Strait et al., 2013). These limits to current fossil analyses underscore the importance of further refining our modern comparative ecomorphological studies and incorporating multiple lines of evidence to improve our understanding of the relationship between feeding behavior and morphology in extant taxa. Studies that enable us to narrow the gap between what is functionally possible based on a particular morphological profile, and how animals actually utilize their morphology in their biological role, have the greatest potential to refine our interpretations and transform current perspectives on primate/hominin paleobiology.
