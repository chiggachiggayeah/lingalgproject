         I. The Title I Program 
        
  The ESEA was far reaching, but its most 
significant provision by far was Title I. Title I funds were initially distributed primarily based on counts of poor children from the 1960 cen- sus, and grants per eligible child were smaller in states that spent less on average.2 Given that higher-poverty states were, on average, lower- spending, this feature of the formula reduced the program's progressivity relative to what it

formula amounts in the late 1960s were strongly increasing in 1960 state child poverty rates, and a linear poverty term alone can explain most of the cross-state variation in per-pupil Title I for-

      II. Title I and the State Poverty Gap 
           in School Spending 
         
  Available data do not allow us to observe 
school spending on poor children per se. Our goal is therefore to understand how the intro- 

other ways. For example, audits from the pro- 

duction of Title I might have affected the gap 

gram's earliest years (Martin and McClure 

in overall school spending across richer and 

1969) show that some school districts used 
Title I funds to make capital investments. Other 
school districts substituted Title I grants for state 

poorer states.3 To this end, we obtained state- 
by-school-year-level data on current spend- ing per pupil in average daily attendance for 

and local funds, either by moving state and local 
revenues away from the poorer schools that received the Title I grants, or by lowering taxes, in which case the grants were not even spent on education. Regulations in the early 1970s sought 

all states in the continental4United States from 
1953-1954 to 2007-2008. These data show 
that real per-pupil school spending increased by

  Was the poverty gap in school spending 
diminished by the introduction of Title I, or were there other forces at work? While we can- not rule out the importance of other factors, 

$2,000 per pupil in 1953-19545 to over $11,000 

we provide some evidence of a contribution of 

in 2007-2008 (2009 dollars). Given this, we 
analyze per-pupil spending in percent terms, 
using its natural log, rather than in dollar terms. 
  Figure 2 shows the relationship between the 1960 child poverty rate and log per-pupil spend- 

Title I to these changes in Figure 3, which plots 
slope coefficients analogous to those shown in Figure 2, but on a year-by-year basis from 1953-1954 to 2007-2008. There is a clear break in trend in 1965-1966, when Title I funds were 

ing right before and well after Title I was imple- 

first distributed. Taking the pre-1965 trend in 

mented. In 1963-1964 (hollow markers), there 
was considerable variation in spending across 

the poverty gradient as the counterfactual, one 
would conclude that Title I reduced the poverty 

states, and this variation was strongly related to 
poverty. In 2006-2007 (solid markers), by con- 

gradient in spending for a decade or so: after 
a sharp decline in 1965-1966, the poverty gap 

trast, the variation in log spending was6virtually 
unchanged from its pre-ESEA level, but the 
analogous regression yields a slope that is half as steep as it was in 1963-1964, with an R2 of 
only 0.17.7 


    5 Our analysis gives each state equal weight, though our 
findings are similar if we weight by enrollment or school- aged population. 
    6 In 1963-1964, the standard deviation of log per-pupil spending was 0.226; in 2006-2007, it was 0.217. 
    7 The figure also shows that while Southern states 
(which we define as those in the former Confederacy) were 

remained roughly constant in the two decades 
following the introduction of Title I and began to decline steadily again around 1990-1991. 
  While Title I thus appears to have stimulated some convergence in school spending across states, it would have needed to be a much larger program to eliminate spending differences across richer and poorer states. We calculate 
 
  
significantly lower spending on average, their lower spend- ing was in line with their significantly higher poverty rates. 
This suggests no "South effect."

School spending has long been negatively 
correlated with poverty at the state level, but this relationship has weakened in the 50 years since passage of the ESEA. We have presented evi- dence that the introduction of Title I contributed to this trend. Nevertheless, Title I was a small program relative to the spending differences

associated with poverty, and substantial poverty

year that Title I was introduced. For sources, see note for Figure 2. 


that if there were no state or local crowd-out and 
nothing else changed, the introduction of Title I 

gaps in spending remain. This is one potential 
reason why Title I has appeared so ineffective in closing the achievement gap. We neverthe- less view these and any other conclusions as tentative given the limitations of our data and methodology. 
  Is Title I therefore failed policy? Not neces- sarily. The ability to withhold education funds 
  
would have reduced the cross-state poverty8gra- 
dient in spending by only about 15 percent. 
  As mentioned above, Title I's introduction also appears not to have had much of an effect on the variation in school spending across states. A considerable share of this more recent variation also appears to owe to per capita state income, not poverty. Figure 4 plots the R2 from

ment to encourage school districts to imple- ment other reforms. At Title I's inception, for example, receipt of funds in the South was conditional on meeting desegregation targets under the 1964 Civil Rights Act. These finan- cial incentives worked, marking the beginning of the end of racially separate schools in the 

year-by-year regressions of log per-pupil school

circles), on real per capita state income (hollow 

attainment (Guryan 2004; Reber 2010; Johnson 

circles), and on both (the x's). Before the ESEA, 
income was slightly more predictive of spend- 
ing than poverty, but only marginally so. There is a clear downward shift in 1965-1966, and the 

2011). More recently, under the No Child Left 
Behind Act of 2001, receipt of Title I funds has 
been tied to adoption of state school account- ability systems-a policy which appears to
