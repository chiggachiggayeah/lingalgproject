Dearomative_Indole
Dearomatization of indoles has been a powerful strategy for organic chemists to access many architecturally complex alkaloids.(1) Due to the ubiquitous nature of the indole unit in important bioactive alkaloids, numerous chemo-, regio-, and enantioselective methodologies have emerged. Some dearomative strategies include allylation,(2) alkylation,(3) arylation,(4) iminium catalysis,(5) and cycloaddition.(6) Dearomative cycloaddition, which is based on the reactivity of the C2═C3 double bond of indole, is an attractive and straightforward approach to fused indoline compounds. Moreover, indolines with a fused five- or six-membered ring at the C2 and C3 positions are well represented in nature (Figure 1).(7)

Indoles have been shown to undergo (4 + 2) cycloaddition reactions to afford hydrocarbazoles.(6c, 6d, 8) Nevertheless, only limited reports are available on dearomative (3 + 2) cycloaddition of indoles.(9) Kerr and Pagenkopf have reported Lewis acid catalyzed C2/C3 cyclopentannulation of indole with 1,1-cyclopropane diesters and 2-methoxy-1-cyclopropane esters, respectively.(9a, 9b) Recently, Tang and co-workers developed a copper-catalyzed enantioselective version.(9c) Barluenga and co-workers have reported an enantioselective (3 + 2) cycloaddition reaction of indole with alkynyl Fischer carbenes,(9d) while Lian and Davies established a rhodium-catalyzed variant with vinyldiazoacetates.(9e) The examples above indicate that the use of 1,3-dipoles to dearomatize the C2═C3 double bond of indole and its derivatives can be a successful strategy to synthesize cyclopentannulated indolines.
1,3-Dipoles have been of particular interest to us because, for some time, our group has been developing annulation and alkylation reactions of indole and related heterocycles.(10, 11) In particular, the oxyallyl cation dipole usually reacts with dienes to furnish seven-membered rings.(12) However, they have also been shown to undergo simple alkylation reactions(13) as well as (3 + 2) cycloadditions with allylsilanes,(14) dienes,(15) furans,(16) and enamines.(17) Nonetheless, little is known about its reactivity in dearomatization processes with substituted indoles. We envisioned that oxyallyl or hydroxyallyl cations generated in situ from α-haloketones may undergo formal dearomative (3 + 2) cycloaddition with indoles. Herein, we describe our progress in this subject matter.
Results and Discussion
We initiated our study by examining the reaction between N-benzylskatole (1) and 2-chlorocyclopentanone 2 (Table 1). Little product was obtained after 24 h using Na2CO3 in a mixture of MeOH/H2O or DMSO (entries 1 and 2). The use of stronger inorganic bases such as NaOH in MeOH or MeOH/H2O did not accelerate the reaction either and still gave low yields after 24 h (entries 3 and 4). Inspired by the reports of Chi, MacMillan, and Harmata,(12a, 13) trifluoroethanol (TFE) was investigated as a solvent. Its use substantially increased the reaction rate (entries 5 and 6). This is likely because, as compared to MeOH, TFE is a stronger H–bond donor and, hence, can more effectively promote enolate formation/enolization as well as weaken the C–Cl bond. Higher concentrations of the reactants also accelerated the reaction (entries 6 and 7). We then investigated three organic bases: Et3N, DIPEA, and DMAP (entries 8, 9, and 10), which shortened the reaction time but furnished poorer yields. The best yield and reactivity were obtained by conducting the reaction in TFE (1 M) at 40 °C (entry 11).

With the optimized conditions in hand, we explored the reaction scope between 2-chlorocyclopentanone (2) and various 3-substituted indoles 4 (Table 2). The reaction worked well, affording good to excellent yields and diastereoselectivities. Electron-rich indoles (Table 2, entry 10) tended to accelerate the reaction, while indoles with a relatively strong electron-withdrawing group (5-CO2Me) appeared unreactive. This reaction was tolerant to different C3 substituents on indole other than methyl, thus allowing additional functionalities such as silylether, amino, allyl, and iodo groups to be introduced into the products (Table 2, entries 6–10, 15). Both the hydroxyl and amino groups needed to be protected so that they would not act as nucleophiles and interrupt the (3 + 2) cycloaddition. That the pendant iodine in entry 15 (Table 2) was not destroyed is a testament to the mildness of the reaction. C2-,C3-disubstituted indoles were not compatible with the reaction when using 2; however, acyclic chloroketones are amenable to cyclization with indoles possessing this substitution pattern (vide infra). We have also examined the reactivity of N-H and N-protected indoles. For instance, N-methyl, -Bn, -allyl, and -iPr indoles worked well, but neither N-H nor N-Cbz protected indoles were suitable substrates. For the products in entries 1 and 11 (Table 2), the relative stereochemical configuration of each diastereomer was established by NOESY experiments (Figure 2). The relative stereochemistries of the remaining products were assigned by analogy.

Attempts to extend the scope of cyclic α-haloketone to include 2-chlorocyclohexanone and 2-chlorocycloheptanone were unsuccessful. The latter was unreactive to N-benzylskatole; the former furnished poor yields of the desired product 7 (eq 1) while affording mostly C2 alkylated product 8, presumably arising from 1,2-migration of a C3 alkylated intermediate followed by aromatization. When both minor and major isomers of 7 were purified and resubjected to the reaction conditions, fragmentation to 8 did not occur, thereby, precluding the possibility that 8 is derived from 7.

The scope and generality of this cycloaddition in terms of indole substitution with acyclic α-haloketones are summarized in Table 3. Unlike the reaction with 2-chlorocyclopentanone (2), C2-,C3-disubstituted indoles were indeed compatible to annulation using acyclic haloketones (Table 3, entries 1 and 2). However, longer reaction times and, in some cases, higher temperatures (Table 3, entries 1–4) were required. The employment of electron-rich indole 11 (Table 3, entry 4) did not accelerate the reaction relative to entry 3. Instead, elevated temperatures were required to drive the reaction to completion. This is likely due to the bulkier isopropyl group of 11. These results also show that the (3 + 2) cycloadditions proceeded with excellent regio- and diastereoselectivities. Single regioisomers were isolated for entries 1–4. Similar results were observed for α-haloketones 14–17 (Table 3, entries 6–9), which also furnished their respective products as single regioisomers. Moreover, compound 23 was formed in high diastereoselectivities relative to the substituent on the α-haloketone fragment (>20:1 of 23:24).

It is noteworthy that, for entries 6–9, a common O-alkylated intermediate 25 was isolated and confirmed by NMR analysis, suggesting the possibility that α-haloketones 14–17 may proceed via the same oxyallyl or hydroxyallyl intermediate. We also discovered that the rearrangement of 25 to a mixture of 23 (minor diasteromer) and 24 (major diastereomer) occurred upon treatment with silica gel or prolonged standing in CH2Cl2 (eq 2).

However, in contrast to results shown in eq 2, 23 was invariably the major diastereomer isolated in the overall reactions for entries 6–9. In order to explain these results, we performed stability experiments on diastereomer 24. We discovered that a mixture of 24 and NaCl in TFE did not epimerize to 23, while such epimerization was observed upon treatment with bicarbonate or carbonate base (eq 3). We also discovered that simply dissolving 24 in EtOAc results in its conversion to 23 over the course of 1 day (eq 3). These data suggest that compound 23 is likely the thermodynamically preferred diastereomer while 24 is the kinetically favored one.

For entries 2, 3, 5–9 (Table 3) regio- and stereochemical assignments were established by extensive NMR analyses, including DEPT, HMBC, HMQC, and NOESY. The regio- and stereochemistry of the products in entries 1 and 4 (Table 3) were assigned by analogy. Further structural confirmation of 23 was established by single crystal X-ray analysis (Figure 3).

In order to gain more detailed mechanistic information regarding these (3 + 2) cycloaddition reactions, kinetic experiments on the reactions for entries 7 and 9 (Table 3) were carried out. As shown in Figure 4, they both behaved similarly with respect to the generation of minor diastereomer 24 (purple line), which was steadily formed throughout both reactions. The most prominent difference between the kinetic profiles is that with the use of 17, there is a significant buildup of the O-alkylated intermediate 25 (Figure 4b; red line) during the first 20 h, whereas, with α-haloketone 15, the level of 25 remained low (Figure 4a). We believe this difference reflects a change in the rate-determining step (discussion to follow). A second significant dissimilarity is that the reaction rate with 15 was much slower as compared to that of 17. This was deduced by comparing their consumption of N-benzylskatole (1) and/or formation of product 23.

Scheme 1 illustrates our proposed mechanism for the (3 + 2) cycloaddition. The reduced acidity of the α-proton of 15 (i.e., higher pKa) as compared to that of 17 makes 15 more resistant to enolization. Moreover, the kinetic acidity of 15 may also be low as a result of the stereoelectronic demands required for enolization/tautomerization (i.e., α-proton needs to be coplanar with the carbonyl π-system). If the activation energy of enolization for 15 were high enough to render this step rate-determining, this would be consistent with the lack of an observed buildup of any intermediates along the pathway toward product when using 15.
figure
Scheme 1. Proposed Reaction Mechanism
In contrast, we believe that enolization of 17 to give 27 (kRE2) is fast relative to kRE1. This would be followed by chloride ionization (aided by H-bonding with TFE) to generate hydroxyallyl cation syn-28-H+. While other cycloaddition reactions are thought to proceed through enolate oxyallyl cations,(12) DFT calculations on our system suggest that a route via hydroxyallyl cation syn-28-H+ may also be available under the reaction conditions (vide infra). In this scenario, N-benzylskatole (1) then attacks syn-28-H+ to form intermediate 29 which possesses a weak C····OH interaction. Harmata, Schreiner, and co-workers have also reported a divergence in reactivity between oxyallyl and hydroxyallyl cations.(18) Removal of the proton with the carbonate base at this point would furnish the observed intermediate 25. Alternatively, the protonated form 29 can redissociate and alkylate at carbon to generate the kinetic cycloadduct 24, which can then isomerize to the thermodynamic product 23. We believe that when using α-haloketone 17, the overall transformation 29 → 24 and then to 23 is rate-determining. The observed buildup of 25 is consistent with its formation prior to the RDS when 17 is used.
As described above, diastereomer 24 is the kinetically favored product, but, under the reaction conditions, it epimerizes to the more thermodynamically favored isomer 23. Our present use of a good H-bonding solvent (TFE), in combination with a weak non-nucleophilic base (Na2CO3), to generate oxyallyl and hydroxyallyl cations by means of soft enolization has been previously reported by MacMillan and Chi.(13)
Attempts to employ compound 30 as a substrate was unsuccessful. What we obtained was alkylation at C2 (eq 4). Transposition of the double bond supports the intermediacy of a hydroxallyl cation species.

Applications toward Natural Products
We have also investigated the potential utility of using the title reaction in the syntheses of several indoline-containing alkaloids. In this regard, we have prepared the core structures of vincorine,(7f-7h) isocorymine,(19) and aspidophyline A (Figure 5).(7e, 7i)

As shown in Scheme 2, ketone 32 was subjected to Baeyer–Villiger oxidation using m-cpba to afford lactone 34 as the major regioisomer (3:1 mixture). Hydrolysis of 34 under alkaline conditions, followed by esterification, furnished cyclohexa-fused indoline 35.

We hypothesized that an analogous regioselective oxidation of 36 could afford lactone 37, a promising precursor to malagashanine (Scheme 3). We first examined the oxidation of 36 with m-cpba in THF at rt. The reaction turned out to be very sluggish. Other oxidants such as H2O2 or t-BuOOH did not perform well either. Finally, we identified peracetic acid as an efficient oxidant in which two lactones were isolated in a 5:1 ratio and a combined yield of 84%. However, neither of the lactones turned out to be 37. The major product was the undesired regioisomer 39, while the other was rearranged lactone 40. The structures of both 39 and 40 have been confirmed by single crystal X-ray analysis.

Scheme 3. Attempted Synthesis of Malagashanine Core
Although Baeyer–Villiger oxidation of compound 36 failed to provide lactone 37, we investigated potential applications for its regioisomer 39. Scheme 4 illustrates three short syntheses of the core structures of vincorine, isocorymine, and aspidophylline A. Debenzylation of lactone 39 by hydrogenolysis and subsequent oxidation with Dess–Martin periodinane (DMP) led to hemiaminal 41. Cleavage of the phthalimide group with MeNH2 liberated the free amine, which was followed by spontaneous ring closure to install the pyrrolidine ring of pentacycle 42. Compound 42 maps well to vincorine and isocorymine. By employing a similar strategy, pentacycle 46 was obtained from 43, providing a good starting point for the synthesis of aspidophylline A.

Computational Studies
DFT studies were carried out using the B3LYP-D3 functional(20) and the 6-311++G** basis set,(21) as implemented in the Jaguar(22) suite of programs. This dispersion corrected functional(23) has proven to be essential in modeling other cyclization reactions of indoles and especially in assessing activation parameters for similar two-component additions for which intermolecular dispersion interactions are crucial components of the overall transition state energetics.(24) A Poisson–Boltzmann solvation model(25) as implemented in Jaguar was applied using methanol as the solvent. The chosen DFT method and basis perform well in predicting structures of this type; a superimposition of the calculated and X-ray structures of 23 is shown in Figure 6.

The key intermediate derived from either haloketone must be the oxyallyl cation syn/anti-28 or its O-protonated form syn/anti-28-H+. We recognize the option that 28 might also be a singlet diradical, as discussed for the unsubstituted parent system.(26) Our own calculations (UDFT/B3LYP-D3/6-311++G**) confirm that the parent species does converge to a singlet diradical structure. However, 28 invariably converges to a closed-shell structure, which was used as the basis for further calculations. We have also attempted to address whether 28 or its protonated form 28-H+ is present under the reaction conditions (vide infra). Deprotonation of 28-H+ requires a base that could be either the solvent or the added base (CO32–). Free energies of the optimized syn- and anti-isomers of 28 and 28-H+ were calculated in a methanol solvent, and relative values are shown in Figure 7. As expected, the syn-isomer is, in each case, significantly more stable than its anti-analogue. Comparison of the ΔG values for deprotonation of syn- and anti-28-H+ to give their deprotonated analogues 28 were made using solvent (MeOH) or solubilized CO32– as bases; the computationally derived absolute free energy of the proton in methanol (−263.5 kcal/mol) was used for the former calculation.(27) Not suprisingly, loss of a proton from syn-28-H+ to the solvent is uphill by 11.8 kcal/mol, while loss of a proton to CO32– to give HCO3– is strongly downhill by 18.2 kcal/mol. Attempts to locate transition states for deprotonations and protonations of these species and others shown later (Figure 8; INT1-H+ → 25, INT3-H+ → 24) were unsuccessful since the kinetic barrier to deprotonation should be very small. Deprotonation of 28-H+ by solvent is unfavorable; however, if stoichiometric CO32– were available in solution, only 28 can be present. The solubility of Na2CO3 in anhydrous MeOH is known to be negligible,(28) and our own measurements in TFE (shake-flask method) indicate a solubility of approximately 0.05 M. Compared to the concentration of chloroketone in the reaction (1.4 M), nearly 4% of base may be available in solution at a given time, raising the possibility that either 28 or 28-H+ may serve as reactive species. Because the kinetics of both the formation of 28-H+ and its deprotonation to give 28 in the presence of a mostly heterogeneous base is unknown, it seemed prudent to consider the intermediacy of both syn-28-H+ and syn-28.

Free energy differences are in kcal/mol, and distances are in Å. Numbers in green are free energy differences between the indicated protonated species plus CO32– and the corresponding deprotonated species plus HCO3–. Other than the two C–H bonds that define the stereochemistry of formation of the second C–C bond, all other C–H hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity.

First, the reaction of oxyallyl cation syn-28 with N-methylskatole was examined using DFT. Two pathways were found as shown in Figure 8. The first, shown in black, allows direct formation of 24 via a concerted but very unsymmetrical TS1, and the second, shown in red, involves stepwise formation of O-bound intermediate 25 via TS2, with subsequent rearrangement to product 24 via TS3. While both pathways involve high-energy transition states, the latter is the lower energy path, consistent with experimental observation of O-bound intermediate 25. Transformation of 25 to 24 occurs via TS3, in which dissociation of the C–O bond in 25 is accompanied by directional rotation as shown by the curved green arrow to afford the relative stereochemical configuration obtained during formation of the second C–C bond in 24. Final epimerization of 24 to 23 is predicted to be downhill by 2.6 kcal/mol, consistent with the observed thermodynamics of the overall reaction. For completeness, the analogous pathway for regioisomeric addition of syn-28 to N-methylskatole was located; the corresponding energy of this TS2 lies 5.7 kcal/mol higher than that shown in Figure 8. DFT correctly predicts formation of the O-bound intermediate and both the regiochemistry and stereochemistry of addition, starting from oxyallyl cation syn-28. However, earlier concerns about the insolubility of the added base raised the possibility that the reaction may flow not from syn-28 but rather from its protonated analogue syn-28-H+.
To evaluate this possibility using DFT, reaction of the protonated hydroxyallyl cation syn-28-H+ with N-methylskatole was also examined, and the resultant lowest energy reaction profile is shown as the blue pathway in Figure 8. Initial reaction of syn-28-H+ with N-methylskatole proceeds via TS1-H+ to give INT1-H+ (identical to 29 in Scheme 1) in which the first C–C bond is formed and there is a long, presumably weak, C····OH interaction. At this stage, kinetically facile loss of a proton (vide supra) can afford the experimentally observed intermediate 25, so it is perhaps not surprising that, in the presence of excess Na2CO3, a buildup of 25 is observed. It is notable that the activation free energy for formation of protonated 25 (INT1-H+) from the hydroxyallyl cation syn-28-H+ and N-methylskatole is only 24.1 kcal/mol, which is significantly lower than the 31.0 kcal/mol required for the direct formation of 25 from oxyallyl cation syn-28 (Figure 8). Consequently, if syn-28 and syn-28-H+ are both present in methanol under these conditions, the reaction of syn-28-H+ with the indole is predicted to be faster. In addition, the subsequent reaction of INT1-H+ to give INT3-H+, which is the O-protonated form of 24, also has a considerably lower overall activation free energy than does the unprotonated analogue (Figure 8). Breaking the C–O bond in INT1-H+ is facilitated by protonation, allowing dissociation via a low energy TS2-H+ to give INT2-H+. Continued elongation of the C–O distance, with directional rotation as shown by the curved green arrow (Figure 8) via TS3-H+ leads to INT-3H+ with the correct relative stereochemistry resulting from construction of the second C–C bond. Transition states for direct formation of either species INT2-H+ or INT3-H+ from starting materials could not be located.
Proton loss from the reaction of INT3-H+ with CO32– is strongly downhill to give 24, so consumption of protons by Na2CO3 appears to be essential to drive the overall reaction by this pathway. It is also noteworthy that the blue pathway shown in Figure 8 is proton-catalyzed and that inefficient or reversible consumption of protons by an added base may still allow this pathway to occur even if only small concentrations of syn-28-H+ are present.
Thus, while a pathway for formation of product 24 from oxyallyl cation syn-28 is available, our DFT calculations predict that it is a higher energy route than that emanating from the hydroxyallyl cation syn-28-H+. As mentioned above, divergent reactivity between oxyallyl and hydroxyallyl cations was also previously observed by Harmata and Schreiner.(18) It seems likely that unless oxyallyl cations are generated by stoichiometric, homogeneous, strong bases, the participation of hydroxyallyl cations as competitive reagents cannot be automatically excluded.
Conclusion
The dearomatization of the C2/C3 double bond of 3-substituted indoles with α-haloketones has been reported. Both high efficiency and high diastereocontrol were observed in the majority of cases. DFT calculations suggest that the preferred mechanism for the formal cycloaddition may proceed via hydroxyallyl cations rather than the corresponding oxyallyl cations. O-Alkylated intermediates are initially formed, followed by isomerization to the observed products. The synthetic potential of this dearomatization process was demonstrated by concise syntheses of the core structures of vincorine, isocorymine, and aspidophylline A. With an eye toward targeting malagashanine, efforts are ongoing in our laboratory to obtain regioisomeric lactone
